Courtesy to aaaleee on unity (https://github.com/aaaleee/UnityScanlinesEffect) for the scanline effects and script used.
Courtesy to DenchiSoft on GitHub (https://github.com/DenchiSoft/UnityAspectRatioController) for the fixed ratio script to constrain the screen.
Note: This tutorial is proving useful for me (https://learn.unity.com/course/2d-beginner-adventure-game?uv=2022.3) which is an "updated" Ruby's Adventure, used for the health UI.
